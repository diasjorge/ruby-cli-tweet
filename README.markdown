# Ruby CLI Tweet

- A command line interface for tweeter.

## Install instructions

- Using thor:

    thor tweet install YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY, YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET

This will ask you to visit a url. Just go there and paste the PIN.

## Using it

    thor tweet tweet "Nice to tweet from the command line"

Enjoy it.

## TODO:

- Make this it's own command so we don't need to type thor
